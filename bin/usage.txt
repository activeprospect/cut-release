Usage: cut-release [<newversion> | patch | minor | major | prepatch | preminor | premajor | prerelease]


  Options:

    --yes, -y       Don't confirm, just release right away. The new version must be supplied.

    --message, -m   If supplied, npm will use it as a commit message when
                    creating a version commit. If the message contains %s then
                    that will be replaced with the resulting version number

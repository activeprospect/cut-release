# cut-release

A command line tool that helps you make faster NPM releases.

### What it does

  * If run in a git repo, ensures that the local repo has no uncommitted changes, that the local branch is tracking
    a remote branch, that the remote branch is not ahead of the local branch, and that the git tag doesn't already
    exist
  * runs `npm version` with the version you specify. If run in a git repo, it will also create a version commit and tag,
    just like what [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) does.
  * pushes commits and tags to the remote repo
  * runs `npm publish` and tags the published module

### Install
